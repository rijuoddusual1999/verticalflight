Hello everyone, I have made this site with basic HTML,CSS which includes grid principles and a custom navbar. 

Since childhood I have always wanted to fly so I dedicate this site to rotary-wing aircraft,any new pull request to make this website better with your idea is most welcome. 

You can preview this website at **https://rijuoddusual1999.github.io/verticalflight/**
